=======
Cat-Man
=======

Like Turtle Time, but instead of Turtle, it's Cat, and instead of Time, it's a complete waste of it.

Made with [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Browserify](http://browserify.org)

```
git clone https://github.com/turtletime/catman
cd catman
npm install
npm start
```

The above script uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) to launch the game window.
It doesn't work on Windows, though a small amount of work will do it.
