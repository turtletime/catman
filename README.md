=======
Cat-Man
=======

Like Turtle Time, but instead of Turtle, it's Cat, and instead of Time, it's a complete waste of it.

Made with [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Browserify](http://browserify.org)

```
git clone https://github.com/turtletime/catman
cd catman
npm install
npm start & npm run watch
```

Go to `http://localhost:8000`. It may take a while (wait up to one minute)
